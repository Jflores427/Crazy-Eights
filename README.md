# CrazyEights

## Project Overview
A Project that relates to the creation of a 1-Player Crazy Eights Game with 3 AI-based opponents. I decided to work on this project to test my C++ skills at the moment, this project was originally completed during 2019, but it was never updated to my GitHub until
now. To elaborate, this program emulates the same behavior as the card game Crazy-Eights, which initially deals each player 6 card randomized card from a 52-card deck. In this case, 24 cards would distributed from the start of the game and the remaining 28 cards would remain inside the deck. Consequently, the user will always go first in this version. At this point, they must either play a card that matches the suit letter or the number that is placed on top of the pile, otherwise they must draw a card. First one to empty their hand is declared the victor!


## Prerequisites
G++ Compiler or C++ compiler equivalent.

## Installation
Step 1: Clone Git Repository or download Crazy-Eights.cpp file
Step 2: Ensure you have G++ compiler already downloaded with g++ --version on Windows.
Step 3: Compile the C++ program with the command "g++ -o <nickname> Crazy-Eights.cpp" within the terminal.
Step 4: Run the newly compiled executable file with "<nickname>.exe"
Step 5: Enjoy your game! The AIs are pretty simplistic in their playing style, so victory should be easily attainable... I hope! :D
Step 6 (EXTRA): If you are really desperate, inputting '?' will reveal your opponent's hand. But do so, at the expense of your own fun :(
As addressed in the Project Overview, this project grants users to play a Crazy
